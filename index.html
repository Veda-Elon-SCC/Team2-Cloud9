        <h2>Albetta Section</h2>
                  <h3>Christmas, <i>my favorite time of the year.</i></h3>
                    <p> I stopped buying material gifts years ago.  Too commercial. Instead I give the gift of experiences to my grandchildren.  We have seen Black Nativity, Nutcracker and Flashdance. Making true memories, I believe will last a lifetime. This  along with a good meal among family and friends and the spirit of goodwill that descends on this world during this time is what its all about.</p>
                    <h2>Happy Holidays Everyone!</h2>

        <h2>Nice Section</h2>
            <h3><b>My Cooking</b></h3>
                <p> One of my interest outside the scool is cooking which I learned from my mom. When I lived in my country,Thailand, I liked to stay in the kitchen with my mom and helped her as assisstant; it made memories between our great relationships. The joy of cooking are that I can make food my family and I love to eat, and feel relax while I am cooking. </p>
                <p>Since I have been living in the U.S. for four years, I always miss the original tastes of Thai cuisine, so I cook Thai food very often. I can say Thai cuisine is one of the most popular cuisines. Thai cuisine is based on special ingredients, such as herbs, and spices. It is not too hard to find basic Thai ingredients from Asian grocery in the U.S., but they are not fresh as buy them at the market in Thailand. I have fun with growing some Thai herbs in the summer, so I am proud of my activities in my garden. Cooking can be an enjoyable experience that is fun for good food, so it does not just a chore for me. </p>

        <h2>Veda Section</h2>
            <h3>Being a Transgender Woman.</h3>
                <p>I came out as transgender about a year ago.  After 40 years it feels great to finaly be me.  The image below is Lady Freedom on the Trans Pride Flag.</p>

        <h2>Long Section</h2>
            <h3>Seeing, meeting and Learning different people from different places</h3>
            
                <p>In the past twenty years, I have lived in 5 different cities in  2 different countries. It's a very awesome experience. You learn the different way of living and working. Each place has their own spirits. Creative-Seattle, fortitude-Boston, diversification-New York, inherited-Beijing, pragmatic-Guangzhou </p>
                
                <img src="/images/long_cities_.jpg" alt = "my cities">
                
                <p>It's very cool to learn the Essence of cultures from people from all over the world. But it's also very difficult. Because, you need to know which is you really want</p>
        
        <h2>Marianne Section</h2>
            <h3>Always running off to somewhere...</h3>
            
                <p>I am absolutely addicted to traveling. I know most people hate airports, but I love the sensation of packing my bags and going to catch a flight (maybe it's because I've rarely had to fly for work).</p>
                
                <p>I love the feeling the night before a trip, and usually can't sleep. I obsessively plan my trips and end up throwing out most of the plans. I love seeing new places and getting into adventures. </p>

                <h4>Belize, an obsession</h4>
                
                <p>One of my favorite places to travel is Belize. Belize gained its independence from England in 1981, when it was known as British Honduras. It has a history full of intrigue, and was a destination for pirates in the 17th and 18th Centuries. It's a small English-speaking Central American country with only 348,000 people. </p>
                
                <p>Belize is known for its coral reefs, jungles, wildlife, Mayan ruins and the Garifuna culture. I am a fan of the Belizean writer, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/158277.Zee_Edgell" style="text-decoration:none">Zee Edgell</a>, and her succinct and evocative prose. Anyone wanting to get a better picture of Belizean life before/after independence should check out one of her books!</p>
